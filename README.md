- 👋 Hi, I’m @ViniMig or just Vini!
- 👀 I’m interested in ... a whole lot of things, one day I am more tomAHto and another I'm more tomEYto. However, I like to believe I am a man of Science who just loves the chaos we call Universe. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... trying to get more indepth knowledge of Python, most specifically OOP, in this case by following pygame Tutorials and also edx "Using Python for Research" course. From time to time I peek into what's up in Machine Learning and Data Science, and hope to get more seriously invested it that someday.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... any interesting project, as long as it ends up bringing value to people and to the Planet (and ultimately the Cosmos) I'm in!
- 📫 How to reach me ... Through here or by email at: vinicio.mpv.oliveira@gmail.com
