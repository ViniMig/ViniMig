- 👋 Hi, I’m @ViniMig or just Vini!
- 👀 I’m interested in ... a whole lot of things, one day I am more tomAHto and another I'm more tomEYto. However, I like to believe I am a man of Science who just loves the chaos we call Universe. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Machine Learning and Data Science, which may switch in a few days to something else and then back again to ML.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... any interesting project, as long as it ends up bringing value to people and to the Planet (and ultimately the Cosmos) I'm in!
- 📫 How to reach me ... Through here or by email at: vinicio.miguel@protonmail.com
